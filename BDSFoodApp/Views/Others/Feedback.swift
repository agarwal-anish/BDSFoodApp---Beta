 1) Once you place the order, specify the time you are coming down. Like 5 min to 10 min so the uncle knows when to prepare it and when the student
 is coming down, add what time you are coming to collect your order in the order queue page, in each rectangle. Also, make the rectangle bigger.

 2) Say which class the student is from, the name, the time they ordered, and what time they will come to collect it - It can be implemented on the order queue's page.

 3) When the student comes to collect, they should show the uncle their order queue, class, and name.

 4) Make the order confirmation page font and main icon + order queue number bigger - scroll view

 5) It should be viewable from the tablet from estimated 2 metres away

 6) Alert box to remind the student to collect their food a few minutes before and after

 7) Have a system that what if people forget their order. Uncle will suffer loss if he makes food and no one collects it.

8) What if the student changes their mind and wants to change their offer?
 
9) Once the order has been completed, will the rectangle box stay in the order queue page forever, have a system so it automatically deletes or you can swipe and delete.
 
 10) Change the red text at the bottom of the order confirmation page so it shows what time you are coming down to collect it and once it goes over the time - the text starts blinking red, before it's blue. Show name, class, order queue, time you are coming down


 11) If the cheese stick runs out and if he needs time to make it, fry it, how will the timing work, or if he has no stock, what will happen?
 
 12) If the person comes late, and if they claim he ordered but it doesn't show, what will happen then?
 
 13) Uncle should have the option to cancel the order
 
 14) There should be a history page so that he can check the orders of the past month observe the pattern and do financing
 
 15) Make all components resizable so they can change its form from tablets, iPads, different sizes, and maybe even phones. - Scaled to fit, resizable attributes
 
 16) Feedback page so students can write feedback to him so he can improve - his food - he can add comments, resolve, and delete the comments if it is bad or not related
 
 17) When uncle changes his menu in the future - it should change in the app, will he do it himself so he needs an interface or do we do it for him? - Whole new section
 
 18) The Order queue page has icons - how will they work, be clickable, and change depending on whether it is declined, accepted, or not decided? once the person collects, does he press the tick or is it before he confirms it. Make it clearer what the tick does.
 
 19) Uncle can prepare every 1 minute +- , 1 order +-, (Depending on each Stall owner) then we can have the time choosing a range in 1 minute. Time slots that can be maxed out to x per each slot.
 
 20) Voice Commands so physical touch is not needed
 
 21) All orders should be submitted before 12.30 - Time slots can restrict this
 
 22) Modify all pages, make them bigger, and modify necessary changes. Keep updating him on the progress, and show him the app progress.
 
 Good Luck!
